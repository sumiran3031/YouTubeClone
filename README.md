🚀 YouTube Clone (Frontend Only)
A responsive frontend web application that replicates the visual design and layout of YouTube using modern CSS techniques. This project focuses strictly on the styling and structure of the interface.


✨ Design Features
This project utilizes CSS Grid and Flexbox for a robust layout, including:

Fixed Header: A sticky navigation bar that stays visible at the top (.header class in header.css).

Fixed Sidebar: A narrow, fixed-position sidebar (.sidebar in sidebar.css) with standard navigation icons.

Responsive Video Grid: A dynamic video thumbnail grid (.video-grid in video.css) that automatically adjusts column counts based on screen size (using repeat(auto-fill, minmax(280px, 1fr))).

Mobile Responsiveness: Includes specific media queries (@media (max-width: 500px)) to optimize the layout for small screens, switching to a single-column view and hiding the sidebar.

Clean Typography: Uses the Roboto font family for a clean, professional look (general.css).
